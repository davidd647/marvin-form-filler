# Marvin Form Filler

A Google Chrome extension that fills all the inputs/selects/textareas in a form with quotes from Marvin the Paranoid Android!

Just click Marvin to fill out all the things.

### Reason for building this:
- Whenever I go to auto-fill forms in Chrome with dummy text, there's always a field here and there that aren't touched. I don't want to auto-fill, and THEN go in to every field that was missed, wasting time entering dummy text... so I built this thing!

### Outstanding issues:
- Marvin is very depressed.

### Directions:
- Clone the repo into a directory
- Go to chrome://extensions
- Turn on Developer mode (there should be a toggle on the top right)
- Click 'LOAD UNPACKED' 
- Select the directory where you cloned the repo to
- The extension should appear in your extensions list! Toggle it on
- Go to a page with a form, and click Marvin!
